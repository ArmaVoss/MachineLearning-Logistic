#Overview

##Goal: Implement a basic Machine Learning Library
-Implemented a modular library that splits up gradient calculations, allowing interchangable loss function/activation functions if wanted
-Runs gradient descent to solve parameters, current using BCE and sigmioid activation function
-Custom vector and matrix class (tried to make it like numpy)

##Future Plans: 
-Implement SVD
-Implemenet Psuedo-matrix inverse to solve paramters for smaller datasets
-Implement linear regression
